# policy-compiler

Implemented in the `policy_compiler` package: `compile(policy) -> CompiledPolicy`
(norms, conflicts, undetermined, residuals, per-norm provenance) and
`check(policy, cases)`, plus the `policy-compiler` CLI. Lowering delegates to the
loomground `deontic` and `norm` planes when present, with `ingest` corroboration
and `governance` validation; see the README. `to_grounding_seam()` emits the
shape the compliance-fleet consumes, so a compiled policy is the norm base the
fleet steers against.
